# MR.GROOVE – NIGHT & DAY

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I don't know what I'm doing
Maybe it's the time to let me go
I think too much what you said
That our love is never die
Go away
And don't forget all dreams what
we had
But someday you will come and
turning back
My heart will break just for one
reason now
If you gonna tell me it's over
to me
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
You had so much reasons
To go away you couldn't do
I will always forgive you
The step you did but it's o.k.
Go away
And don't forget all dreams what
we had
But someday you will come and
turning back
My heart will break just for one
reason now
If you gonna tell me it's over
to me
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
I don't know what I'm doing
Maybe it's the time to let me go
I think too much what you said
That our love is never die
Go away
And don't forget all dreams what
we had
But someday you will come and
turning back
My heart will break just for one
reason now
If you gonna tell me it's over
to me
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
And don't forget all dreams what
we had
But someday you will come and
turning back
My heart will break just for one
reason now
If you gonna tell me it's over
to me
Night & day…
Night & day…
Night & day I feel empty and
lonely
You get me out of this
Gimme one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my knees
Gimme one please
